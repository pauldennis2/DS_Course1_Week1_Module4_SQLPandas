    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab assessment, you will practice using SQL statements and the `.query()` method provided by Pandas to manipulate datasets. Pandas and SQL are both powerful tools for data manipulation and analysis, but they excel in different areas. SQL is designed for querying and managing relational databases, while pandas is a Python library for data manipulation and analysis in memory. By combining these tools, you can leverage the strengths of both:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Extraction: Use SQL to efficiently query large datasets stored in databases. SQL is optimized for this and can handle complex joins and aggregations at the database level.\n",
    "- Data Loading: Transfer the query results into pandas DataFrames. This brings the data into Python's ecosystem, where it can be further manipulated and analyzed.\n",
    "- Data Manipulation: Once the data is in a DataFrame, use pandas' rich set of functions for cleaning, transforming, and analyzing data. Pandas is particularly good at handling time series data and performing operations on entire columns or datasets at once.\n",
    "- Analysis and Visualization: With the data in pandas, you can easily perform statistical analyses, create visualizations, or feed the data into machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "This combination allows you to work with large datasets that might not fit into memory by using SQL to pre-process and filter the data before bringing it into pandas. It also lets you use familiar SQL syntax for initial data extraction before switching to pandas' pythonic interface for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",

    "* Compare accessing data in a DataFrame using query methods and conditional logic\n",
    "* Query DataFrames with SQL using the `pandasql` library\n",
